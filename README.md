## Branching Strategy
    I will be using the GitHub Flow branching strategy. 
    This strategy allows me to focus on one feature or hot-fix at a time, improving efficiency.
    This is a very simple, yet effective branching strategy, and can even be used with complex projects.
    I will be the only person working on these projects, so only one version of the code will be available at all times.
    
    Branches I will be using:
        -main
        -feature
        
    Features will first be released into the feature branch for testing and evaluation.
    After the feature is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
    Rollbacks to the main branch can be performed if necessary.
